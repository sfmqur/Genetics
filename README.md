# Genetics
The library is the geneticsLibrary package.  A collection of classes that allow hereditary boolean arrays for use with procedural generation.  Like biological genetics.  

The concept is that a world, or anything else procedurally generated,  can be generated using the gene pool as the seed.  The seeds from two objects can be merged to create a child object with traits from both parents.  



There are two alleles per gene.  There will be a dominant allele and recessive allele.  Incomplete dominance will be put in later.
